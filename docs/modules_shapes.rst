Shapes Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``shapes`` module provides simple functions to generate commonly used analytic and spline geometries using
NURBS-Python (geomdl).

Prior to NURBS-Python (geomdl) v5.0.0, the ``shapes`` module was automatically installed with the main package.
Currently, it is maintained as a separate package.

Installation

The easiest method to install is via ``pip``.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --user geomdl.shapes
